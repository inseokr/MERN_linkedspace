MessageEditor re-factoring

1. let's read the business logic again
+ props
	* callerType
		+ parent
			* contact list: 
				case 1> my own listing
					* direct friends
				case 2> listing from friend
					* direct friends
					<note> working through direct friends... so case 1 and 2 should be the same. 
				q1. how to activate the messaging? 
				: map/messaging should work for both child listing and parent. Currently the parent listing is not highlighed.
				  Probably we should implement onclick of parent listing as well.
				  task1> Will update the current active child listing to negative in this case. 

		+ child
		: obsolete
		+ msg_window
		+ general
		: currently not used. By default, all the direct friends will be in the contact list. 
			* let's keep it this way. search should be in the next release. not MVP item. 
	* childListing
	* clickHandler
	* parent_listing
	* index: in the case of child

	task2> MessageEditor will be used only in the message window now

	q2. let's check what's done when child listing is clicked.

		clickHandler(index); // highlight the listing
		setCurrentChildIndex(index); // 
		updateMessageContext(); // TenanaLisingDashboard::updateRightPane is called


So MessageEditor will be used only to select contact for now
1. messageEditorCallerType
: we only need to know if it's general or listing_dashboard

Hmm... MessageEditor will be used to add new chatting party. So it will launch the modal always.... we don't need to do anything different in this case.

==> Yay... I just cleaned everything...
